Intents can be specified as asynchronous messages which allows application components such as activities, content providers, broadcast receivers, services, etc. to request functionalities from other android components. 

There are two types of Intents:

1.	Explicit Intent
2.	Implicit Intent

1.	Explicit Intent:
-	Explicit Intent requires targetâ€™s app name or fully classified component class name to satisfy the intent.


2.	Implicit Intent:
-	Implicit Intent requires to declare a general action to perform, which will be satisfied by other components from another app.


In this assignment, we will see how implicit intents work through two examples by invoking web link and by calling a phone app.
